# data-analytics-task-2

I successfully designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze BigMart sales data, following the key data visualization best practices:

1. **Selected the Right Charts**  
   - Used bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and box plots to suit the nature of categorical and numerical data.

2. **Maintained Clarity**  
   - Avoided clutter and limited the color palette to highlight important trends without overwhelming the viewer.

3. **Highlighted Key Insights**  
   - Emphasized high-value categories like *Snack Foods*, *Supermarket Type1 outlets*, and MRP price clusters using data labels and callouts.

4. **Added Context to Every Visual**  
   - Included clear titles, axis labels, and tooltips to ensure each chart communicated its purpose effectively.

5. **Focused on Business Insights**  
   - Delivered actionable findings, such as dominant product categories, outlet performance by region and type, and price band analysis.

6. **Created a Summary Slide / Storyboard**  
   - Final slide presented a concise narrative of trends, supported by visuals, to answer key business questions clearly.
